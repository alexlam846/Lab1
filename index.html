  <p>&amp; Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
  <p>Introduction:</p>
  <p>My name is Alexis Lam and I am a second year majoring ITM at IIT.<p>
  <p>I enjoy outdoor activities such as football and soccer. I play video games and read comics on my spare time.<p>
  <p>I try to be open minded with all types of music, including country. My favorite food is sushi, and I want to go to Japan one day for this reason<p>
